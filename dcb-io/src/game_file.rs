/// A type that abstracts over a the game reader.
///
/// # Game reader
/// The game file is a `.bin` file, of the type `MODE2/2352`.
///
/// This means that the file is divided into sectors of size
/// 2352 bytes, each with it's data structure.
///
/// For us the only thing that matters is the data section
/// of each sector, which is 2048 bytes long.
///
/// This type allows reading and writing in `DataAddress` addresses,
/// which are reader offsets in terms of the 2048 byte data section,
/// instead of the 2352 byte sectors.
///
/// # Parameters
/// `GameFile` is generic over `R`, this being any type that implements
/// `Read`, `Write` and `Seek`, thus being able to read from either a
/// reader, a buffer in memory or even some remote network location.
///
/// # Read/Write Strategy
/// The strategy this employs for reading and writing currently is to
/// get the current 2048 byte block and work on it until it is exhausted,
/// then to get a new 2048 byte block until the operation is complete.
/// This will require an `io` call for every single 2048 byte block instead
/// of an unique call for all of the block, but due to the invariants required,
/// this is the strategy employed.
///
/// # Seek
/// All seeks are done in data addresses, the stream position is also in data addresses.
