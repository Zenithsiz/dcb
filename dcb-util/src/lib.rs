// Lints
#![warn(clippy::restriction, clippy::pedantic, clippy::nursery)]
// Instead of `unwrap`, we must use `expect` and provide a reason
#![forbid(clippy::unwrap_used)]
// We must use `unsafe` in unsafe `fn`s and specify if the guarantee is
// made by the caller or by us.
#![forbid(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]
// We'll disable the ones we don't need
#![allow(clippy::blanket_clippy_restriction_lints)]
// Necessary items may be inlined using `LTO`, so we don't need to mark them as inline
#![allow(clippy::missing_inline_in_public_items)]
// We prefer tail returns where possible, as they help with code readability in most cases.
#![allow(clippy::implicit_return)]
// We're fine with shadowing, as long as the variable is used for the same purpose.
// Hence why `clippy::shadow_unrelated` isn't allowed.
#![allow(clippy::shadow_reuse, clippy::shadow_same)]
// We panic when we know it won't happen, or if it does happen, then a panic is the best option
#![allow(clippy::panic, clippy::expect_used, clippy::unreachable, clippy::todo)]
// We use `expect` even in functions that return a `Result` / `Option` if there is a logic error
#![allow(clippy::unwrap_in_result)]
// We find it more important to be able to copy paste literals such as `0xabcd1234` than
// being able to read them, which does not provide many benefits
#![allow(clippy::unreadable_literal, clippy::unseparated_literal_suffix)]
// We separate implementations per their functionality usually, such as constructors, getters, setters, and others.
#![allow(clippy::multiple_inherent_impl)]
// Many operations we need to repeat, and to keep symmetry
#![allow(clippy::identity_op)]
// We only introduce items before their first usage, which sometimes is half-way through the code.
// We make sure that we only use the item after introduced, however.
#![allow(clippy::items_after_statements)]
// Useful for when they either change a lot with new variants / data,
// or for symmetry purposes
#![allow(clippy::match_same_arms)]
// In this library we have very grain-level error types, each function
// will have it's own error type ideally, so any errors are explicit
// by the type, without needing a section for them
#![allow(clippy::missing_errors_doc)]
// Although we generally try to avoid this, this can happen due to our module organization.
// In the future, this lint should be removed globally and only enabled for modules which
// actually require the use of it.
#![allow(clippy::module_inception, clippy::module_name_repetitions)]
// We use integer arithmetic and operations with the correct intent
#![allow(clippy::integer_arithmetic, clippy::integer_division)]
// We prefer using match ergonomic where possible
#![allow(clippy::pattern_type_mismatch)]
// Sometimes the blocks make it easier to invert their order
#![allow(clippy::if_not_else)]
// This lint triggers when using `assert`s and `todo`s, which is unsuitable for this project
#![allow(clippy::panic_in_result_fn)]
// A `match Option / Result / Bool` can sometimes look cleaner than a `if let / else`
#![allow(clippy::single_match_else, clippy::match_bool)]
