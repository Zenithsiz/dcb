## + Others

Other binaries are found in `dcb-tools`, although most will be command line tools to help pack or unpack the
game files into other format.

# Libraries

The project is split into several libraries, although most of these aren't necessarily tied
to the `dcb` game and may split off into their own repositories / packages eventually.

## `dcb`

Library that implements the game logic, such as the cards and decks

## `dcb-bytes`

Library for a `Bytes` interface, used to serialize and deserialize various
game components.

## `dcb-bytes-derive`

Library for `dcb-bytes` to derive `Bytes` via several macros

## `dcb-cdrom-xa`

Library to interact with `CD-ROM/XA Mode 2 Form 1` `.bin` type files, which
the game is contained within.

## `dcb-drv`

Library to interact with the `.drv` files found within the game disc. These
are filesystems which contain the proper game files.

## `dcb-exe`

Library to interact with the game code within the `SLUS_013.28` file containing
all of the game code.
Contains a full implementation of the `mips r3000` assembly variant for the psx, as well
as several helpers to find functions and data hiding within the binary.

## `dcb-io`

Library that uses several other components to provide a direct and easy way to access
the game file, given all of of it's layers.

## `dcb-iso9660`

Library to help parse the `iso9660` filesystem the game is stored within.
Not currently used, as the filesystem is complicated.

## `dcb-pak`

Library used to interact with the `.pak` files within the game files

## `dcb-tim`

Library used to interact with the `.tim` files within the game files
