//! `dcb` executable decompilation and recompilation.
//!
//! This crate aims at being able to decompile the original binary into
//! `mips` assembly, which may then be modified and compiled back into the binary.
//!
//! The decompiled assembly will have annotations for each function and data, both
//! manual, loaded from a `resources/known_*.yaml` and heuristically found.
